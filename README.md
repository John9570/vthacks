# ü™ê spaCy Project: Demo NER in a new pipeline (Named Entity Recognition)

A minimal demo NER project for spaCy v3 adapted from the spaCy v2 [`train_ner.py`](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/v2.3.x/examples/training/train_ner.py) example script for creating an NER component in a new pipeline.
